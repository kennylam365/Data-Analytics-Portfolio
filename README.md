# Google DA Cyclistic Capstone
This is my Google Data Analytics Cyclistic Capstone Project

The raw data for my cyclistic capstone project is included in a url in the rmd file, remember to set the working directory accordingly and ensure that you have the required packages installed, (tidyverse, lubridate, and ggplot2)

All visualizations created are done using tableau, and can be accessed using the link in the powerpoint slide or via this link: https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleCyclisticCapstone/Avgridelength?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link. 

Please start from the Cyclistic DA Capstone rmd file or the html file if RStudio is not installed, followed by the Cyclistic Capstone powerpoint.

Thanks for reading
