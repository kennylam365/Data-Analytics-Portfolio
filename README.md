# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for all my data analytics related projects.

The raw data for my cyclistic capstone project is included in a url in the rmd file, remember to set the working directory accordingly and ensure that you have the required packages installed, (tidyverse, lubridate, and ggplot2)

All visualizations created are done using tableau, and can be accessed using the link in the powerpoint slide. Start from the Cyclistic DA Capstone rmd file, followed by the Cyclistic Capstone powerpoint. The other file, Netflix Capstone is a separate Capstone project of mine done using tableau and excel.

Thanks for reading
